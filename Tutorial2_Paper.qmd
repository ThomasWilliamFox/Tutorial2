With the increased relevance of computing technology in our society, municipal public libraries have become spaces that work to facilitate community building through open access to computing technologies such as desktop computers, laptops, and the internet. The City of Toronto is home to one hundred public library branches, each of which offers free use of computer workstations for community members. In this tutorial, I analysed the Toronto Public Library's desktop workstation usage data collected between 2018 and 2022 to determine how many sessions have taken place each year, per branch, on average.

I began planning by making a sketch of the required data that would be needed and a visual representation of the graph that would be produced after analyzing the data (see @fig-planning). I then simulated the required data set by randomly assigning a usage count with each for the one hundred branches for the 5 years of collected data by following the simulation examples in Telling Stories with Data [@tellingstories]. After this, I gathered the Library Workstation Usage data set from Open Data Toronto using the opendatatoronto package [@opendata].

The next step was processing and cleaning the data set by using the statistical programming language R [@citeR]. I did this with the help of the examples from Chapter Two in Telling Stories with Data as a guide [@tellingstories]. Throughout this process, I also used the R language packages, knitr [@knitr], dplyr [@dplyr], tidyverse [@tidyverse], and janitor [@janitor] to help clean and display the data. I also used gitcreds [@gitcreds] and usethis [@usethis] to facilitate version control. Following the cleaning of my data, I built a graph to represent the average number of workstation sessions that took place at each branch over the given five years (see @fig-graph).

I found that 2018 had the highest recorded computer work space usage with an average of 42,814 sessions per branch. Usage numbers in 2019 dropped slightly to an average of 39,875. The recorded usage in 2020 dropped significantly to an average of 10,208 sessions. The lowest usage was in 2021 with an average of 4790 sessions per branch. Numbers recovered moderately in 2022 with 14,841 sessions per branch. 

The Toronto Public Library's computer work space usage dropped marginally between 2018 and 2019 but a further analysis of trends may conclude this is a normal variation. The drop in usage from 2019 to 2020 however may be reflective of COVID-19 public safety measures which caused many public spaces in Canada to restrict public access. This continued through 2021 where the data shows the lowest usage of public computers at the libraries. However, a recovery is evident in the 2022 numbers, possibly reflecting an easing of public safety measures. An analysis of the 2023 data, when made available, could give insight into how public usage has changed compared to pre-pandemic levels as most of Canada's pandemic related restrictions have been lifted.
